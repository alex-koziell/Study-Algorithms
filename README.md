Algorithm Design and Analysis Practice, closely following Princeton's "Introduction to Algorithms" Course

# Steps to Developing a Usable Algorithm:
1. Model the problem.
2. Find an algorithm that solves it.
3. Analysis
   *(a) Fast enough? Fits in memory?
   *(b) If not, figure out why.
4. Find a way to adress any problems.
5. Iterate until requirements are satisfied.
