# Study-Algorithms
Algorithm Design and Analysis Practice, closely following Princeton's "Algorithms I" Course

# Steps to Developing a Usable Algorithm:
1. Model the problem.
2. Find an algorithm that solves it.
3. Analysis
   1. Fast enough? Fits in memory?
   2. If not, figure out why.
4. Find a way to adress any problems.
5. Iterate until requirements are satisfied.

# Scientific method:
1. Observe some feature of the natural world.
2. Hypothesize a model that is consistent with the observations.
3. Predict events using the hypothesis.
4. Verify the predictions by making further observations.
5. Validate by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.

### Additional Requirements:
- Experiments must be reproducible.
- Hypotheses must be falsifiable.

# Mathematical modelling of running time:
- Total running time: sum of cost Ã— frequency for all operations.
- Need to analyze program to determine set of operations.
   - Cost depends on machine, compiler.
   - Frequency depends on algorithm, input data.
